HelloHue for Plex and Philips Hue
=================

##### Sync and control your Philips Hue lights with Plex!

**Credits**
This Channel is based on PlexWink by vanstinator.

### Behavior

This channel detects when a media is playing, paused or stopped on your Plex Clients. Then it checks if it's a video, the client name, and the user who owns the stream. If it matches your criteria it triggers your lights with the actions you have set up.
You can also turn your lights on and off inside the channel.

### Configuration

The config is pretty simple and only needs to be done once. Configure your settings following the details below.
One room is composed of **one client**, **one or multiple users** and **one or multiple lights**, as well as the actions : on play, on stop, on pause, dim value, and only trigger if it's dark outside.

* ```Plex.tv login``` is your Plex login.
* ```Plex.tv passwords``` is your Plex password. It is only sent to plex.tv to get an identification token (so you must have a working internet access).
* ```Plex Server Address``` is the local adress to reach your server.
* ```Philips Hue Bridge Address``` is the ip address of your Philips Bridge.
* ```Nearest city from your location``` Used to calculate to calculate sunrise/sunset hours at your location.

* ```Name of plex client able to trigger in room 1``` You can find the list of users in PMS -> settings -> devices. Only put ONE client per room. If your have two clients in the same room, activate an other room and fill the settings with the other clients name and the same lights names.

* ```Randomize hue and saturation on Dim/Turn On in room 1``` will randomize your light color each time the action turn on or dim is fired.
